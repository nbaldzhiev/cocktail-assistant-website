# Cocktail Assistant Website

A very simple website to practice HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The website's sole purpose is to practice FE development.

## Description

This project is a simple website, which uses a free [Cocktails API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), to dynamically load either:
* A single random cocktail;
* Multiple cocktails specified by an input for entering an ingredient. The page then renders multiple cocktails.

The website is somewhat responsive with a single breakpoint at max-width 768px to allow for better rendering on smartphones.
The CSS code is very chaotic, but, again, this is just a purely educational project.
